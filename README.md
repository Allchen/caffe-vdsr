# Caffe_VDSR
This is a implementation of "Accurate Image Super-Resolution Using Very Deep Convolutional Networks"[http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04587] in caffe.

# Instruction
VDSR (Very Deep network for Super-Resolution) is an end-to-end network with 20 convolution layers for single image super-resolution. The performance of VDSR is better than other state-of-the-art SISR methods, such as SRCNN, A+ and CSCN.
